this is probably the wrong way to do this, but we are using the following to make
SELINUX permissive so the web server on the local network works.

You mission is to figure out how to permissible just the web server without changing anything else, later

$ getenforce   // tells you the current state of SELINUX

$ setenforce 0  // sets SELINUX to permissive

$ setenforce 1  // sets SELINUX to enforcing
