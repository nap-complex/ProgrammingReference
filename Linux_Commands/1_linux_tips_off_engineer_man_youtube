grabbed off youtube "engineer man" video called 8 super heroic Linux commnad that you probably aren't using"

1. sudo !!, we knew that already

2. open an editor to run a command: $ ctrl+e+x  [ this didn't work on my machine ]

3. create a super fast ram disk:
	mkdir -p /mnt/ram
	mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /mnt/ram -o size=8192M

4. don't add acommnad to history ( start with a leading space )
	$  ls -l   // instead of 
	$ ls -l

5. fix a really long command that you messed up
	$ fc
	but in your case:
	$ fc -e vim              { the -e command means "editor", I suspect, and this will use the vim editor for the command fix }

6. tunnel ( local port 3337 -> remote hosts 127.0.0.1 on port 6379 )
	ssh -L 337:127.0.0.1:6379 root@emkc.org -N

7. quckly create folders 
	mkdir -p folder/{sub1,sub2}/{sub1,sub2,sub3} 

8. intercept stdout and log to file
	cat file | tee -a log | cat > /dev/null

9. exit terminal but leave all processes running
	disown -a && exit
