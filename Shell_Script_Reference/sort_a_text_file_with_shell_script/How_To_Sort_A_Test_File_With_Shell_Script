We learned this from: https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/58e72888-6340-46ac-b488-d31aa4058e9c/entry/linux_sort_command_sort_lines_of_text_files9?lang=en
There's lot's more good stuff there about "sort"


Well, that couldn't have been much easier...
from the command line do this:


$ sort file_you_want_sorted >> where_you_want_the_sorted_information_dumped


In out trials "sort" did not change the actual file but output the sorted contents of that file.

We consider this a major victory for Linux.
