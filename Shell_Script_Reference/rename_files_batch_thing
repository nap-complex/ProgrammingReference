How to rename files recursively and stuff:

# this finds all the " in a folder / file system and gets rid of them
$ find -iname '*"*' -exec rename 's/"//' '{}' \+

# this does the same but for the controlled character -> ?
$ find -iname '*\?*' -exec rename 's/\?//' '{}' \+

not sure about that escape character in front of the ?*'... look into that
