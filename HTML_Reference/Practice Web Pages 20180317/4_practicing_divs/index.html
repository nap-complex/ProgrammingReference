          <h1 id="lmd">This is a large middle div!</h1>

          <h3>And now for some boxes:</h3>

          <div id="box_1">
            <p>
            <span class="box_titles">Box: box_1</span>
            <br /><br />
            This should be the first box: box_1.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div id="box_2">
            <p>
              <span class="box_titles">Box: box_2</span>
            <br />
            <br />
              This should be an other box: box_2.
              And now lets see what filling it up with words does
              to the width.  We are hoping it moves it all the way
              to the right.
            <br />
            <br />
              That was a little more fiddly that we would have liked.
              But I guess for now that is what we are stuck with.
              Check it all again later when you are smarter.

        <h3>This is the box header for box_4</h3>
        <P>
          Lets try some paragraphs here in box_4 since we don't have
          the alignment things and see what happens.
        </P>
        <P>
          This is the second paragraph.
