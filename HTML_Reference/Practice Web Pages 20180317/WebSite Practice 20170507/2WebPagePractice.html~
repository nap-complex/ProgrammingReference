		The image will float to the right of the text. Maybe I should put a whole lot more text
		in since the image is real big, or at least would not be that easy to see if it was
		the size of that little light bulb in the tutorial.</p>

	<h2>I wonder if this will end up green...?</h2>
	
	<p>Why didn't h2 end up being green?  Oh, never mind, it's green now.  Now test the F5 to see if that
	 reloads the webpage quickly in firefox.  Looks like it does.  Now fix the text color and move on
	  to the next thing.</p>
	
	<h3>
	You may have notice that h3 headers now automatically get a box around them.  Do not be alarmed.
	This is a thing in the css style sheet connected with this web page.  Go on about your business. Except now 
	to notice that it also has padding, as a new development.  It looks like margin is the space between
	the outside of the box and the rest of the document and padding in the space between what is inside
	the box and the border of the box.
	</h3>
	
	<h3 id="p01">Of course, there are always exceptions.  Like this h3 header, id=p01</h3>
	
	<h3>Now this should be back to the regular h3 header type.  Is it?</h3>
	
	
	<!-- this is the bookmarked image, I hope. -->
	<p>This picture is here to give that bookmark near the top of the page something to link to.</p>
	<a id="C4">
	<img title="This is a picture for bookmark practice" src="NF/bk.jpg" alt="a picture of a sunset" style="width:600px;height:400px;">
	</a>
	
	<!-- This is a GIF image displayed... maybe... -->
	<!-- the tutorial says to use style attribute when displaying pictures so that no external style 
	interferes with the way you want it displayed. -->
	<img src="ww.gif" alt="animated woman walking picture" style="padding:50px;width:200px;height:300px;">	
	
	
	<p>And now for something completely similar:</p>
	<p class="error">I am different, because I used a class called error to style me.</p>
