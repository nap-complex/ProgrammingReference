        After 20 years of carpentry pain doesn't mean anything anymore, not the way you people use the word, anyway.  But I don't like to burden my friends with it...

    <h5>Mazzy Star, sideways, sorta</h5>
    <p>
        I look to you and I see nothing<br>
        I look to you to see the truth<br>
        I want to hold the hand inside you<br>
        I want to take the breath that's true<br>
        Fade into you<br>
        You put your hands into your head<br>
        and Smiles cover your heart<br>
        Fade into you<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        a seering, violent inteligence...

    <h4>The Cure: Disintegration and Pictures of You, sorta</h4>
    
    <p>
        I miss the kiss of treachery<br>
        The shameless kiss of vanity<br>
        <br>
        I leave you with photographs<br>
        Pictures of trickery<br>
        Stains on the carpet<br>
        And Stains on the memory<br>
        Songs about happiness murmered in dreams<br>
        <br>
        Remembering you fallen into my arms<br>
        Crying for the death of your heart<br>
        You were stone white, so delicate, lost in the cold<br>
        You were always so lost in the dark<br>
        Remembering you, how you used to be<br>
        Slow drowned, you were angels<br>
        So much more than everything<br>
        Hold for the last time then slip away quietly<br>
        Open my eyes but I never see anything<br>
        If only I'd thought of the right words<br>
