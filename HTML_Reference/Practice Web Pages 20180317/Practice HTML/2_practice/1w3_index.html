        Filler:  maybe the point of those tombs with the passages for the equinox are there because they work even if it is cloudy.  On the surface you would need clear skies to see the sun rise, but at the end of a long dark passage the sun shows even through the clouds.  -  Could probably toss that into a vampire book somewhere...
