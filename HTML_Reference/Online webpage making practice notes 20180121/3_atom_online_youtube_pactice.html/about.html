           <p>Seat thyself sultanically among the moons of Saturn, and take high abstracted man
             alone; and he seems a wonder, a grandeur, and a woe. But from the same point, take
             mankind in mass, and for the most part, they seem a mob of unnecessary duplicates,
             both contemporary and hereditary. But most humble though he was, and far from
             furnishing an example of the high, humane abstraction; the Pequodâ€™s carpenter was
             no duplicate; hence, he now comes in person on this stage.</p>

               year ago, six months ago, I thought that I was an artist. I no longer think about
               it, I am. Everything that was literature has fallen from me. There are no more
               books to be written, thank God. This then?  This  is  not  a  book...</p>

          <p>"I am so thoroughly healthy and empty. No dreams, no desires. I am like the
            luscious deceptive fruit which hangs on the Californian trees. One more ray
            of sun and I will be rotten."</p>
