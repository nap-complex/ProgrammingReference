						Immediately after Lincoln's re-election to the Presidency, in an off-hand
			speech, delivered in response to a serenade by some of his admirers on
			the evening of November 10, 1864, he spoke as follows:
		</p>
		<p>
			"It has long been a grave question whether any government not too strong
			for the liberties of its people can be strong enough to maintain its
			existence in great emergencies. On this point, the present rebellion
			brought our republic to a severe test, and the Presidential election,
			occurring in regular course during the rebellion, added not a little to
			the strain.... The strife of the election is but human nature
			practically applied to the facts in the case. What has occurred in this
			case must ever occur in similar cases. Human nature will not change. In
			any future great national trial, compared with the men of this, we shall
			have as weak and as strong, as silly and as wise, as bad and as good.
			Let us therefore study the incidents in this as philosophy to learn
			wisdom from and none of them as wrongs to be avenged.... Now that the
			election is over, may not all having a common interest reunite in a
			common fort to save our common country? For my own part, I have striven
			and shall strive to avoid placing any obstacle in the way. So long as I
			have been here, I have not willingly planted a thorn in any man's bosom.
			While I am deeply sensible to the high compliment of a re-election and
			duly grateful, as I trust, to Almighty God for having directed my
			countrymen to a right conclusion, as I think for their own good, it adds
			nothing to my satisfaction that any other man may be disappointed or
			pained by the result."
