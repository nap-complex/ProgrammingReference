How much of infinity is it going to take those monkeys to type Hamlet?

assumptions:
1.  we're gonna go easy on the spelling, as shakespeare didn't seem that worried about it either
2.  caps and punctuation... not gonna worry about caps for the first try.  Punctuation... we have to worry about that because it can change the meaning.

Does it matter that it is an infinite number of monkeys?  No, I don't think so.  Cause how would you combine what they are doing on different typewriters?  ... just think it through, are 10 monkeys going to type words with a frequency 10 times greater than one monkey?  I think so, but maybe do an actual test to show it.

Typewriter:  IBM selectric of course.
