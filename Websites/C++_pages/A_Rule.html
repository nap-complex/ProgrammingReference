		NOTE: Because floating-point constants are normally stored in memory as doubles, some compilers 
		issue a warning message when you assign a floating-point constant to a float variable.  For example, if 
		num is a float, the following statement might cause the compiler to generate a warning message:
		</div>
		<div class="grid-item">
		num = 14.725;
		</div>
		<div class="grid-item">
		You can suppress the error message by appending the f suffix to the floating-point constant,
		as show here:
		</div>
		<div class="grid-item">
		num = 14.725f;
		</div>
		<div class="grid-item">
		If you want to force a value to be stored as a long double, append an L to it, as shown here: 
		</div>
		<div class="grid-item">
		1034.56L
		</div>

	<h3>Remember, chars are integers:</h3>
	<p>Characters are stored as integers, so if you "char A = 66" then A will hold 'B'</p>

    <hr/>
	<h3>static_cast, live it, learn it, love it:</h3>
	<p>convert variable types by using:</p>
	<p>int = static_cast<int>(double);</p>
	<p>This puts the truncated value of double into int</p>

    <hr/>
    <h3>Clearing the terminal screen:</h3>
    <p>You can use => system("clear");  which needs => #include &ltcstdlib&gt</p>
    <p>For Windows => system("cls");</p>
    <p> ... the internet doesn't think you should use system() for some reason, don't
    know if they meant just for Windows, or Linux and Windows...</p>
    <p>Maybe better => cout &lt&lt "\033[2J\033[1;1H"; ... not sure what that is, but it works.</p>
    <p>or.. you can just => cout &lt&lt endl; a bunch, but this leaves your output at the bottome of the screen.</p>

    <hr/>
    <h3>Static local variable:</h3>
    <p>static local variable is a local varible in a function that persists after the function closes,</p>
    <p>and for the life of the program run.</p>
    <p>=> static int num = 0;</p>
