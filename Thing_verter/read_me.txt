make a c program that converts meters to feet

we want it to take meters as an argument from the command line and return feet and close the program

so, something like:

$ thing 15000

and return

$ 15,000 meters is =>  48,750 feet

git on it

... and if that works, maybe gerneralize it to all metric / correct measurement types
